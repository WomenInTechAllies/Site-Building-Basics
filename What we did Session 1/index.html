        <p>They say you’re never supposed to meet your idols. In this case, it’s a good thing your idol is inanimate. Cheeseburgers
            are never going to give you up or let you down. They’ll also never run around or desert you. They’ll never make
            you cry, unless it’s from sheer joy. Cheeseburgers certainly won’t say goodbye either. Finally, cheeseburgers
            are incapable of telling lies or hurting you. On the flip side, they can still Rick Roll you.</p>
